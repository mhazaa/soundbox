# Soundbox
https://magdi-hazaa.com/work/soundbox/

Soundbox is a web app I programmed with JS. It transcribes text into sound either directly from the keyboard, or through three layers of text playing simultaneously. I don't own the sounds, but I added the functionality to upload your own audio for each key. Unfortunately, Soundbox doesn't work (at least as expected) in mobile browsers, since they require explicit user input for each audio to play. However, it works on all modern browsers (at least all the ones I tested!)
