# Soundbox

Soundbox is a web app I programmed with JS. It transcribes text into sound either directly from the keyboard, or through three layers of text you can pre-enter and have them all play simultionously. I don't own the sounds, but I also added a functionaility that allows the user to upload their own sounds for each key. Unfortinately, Soundbox doesn't work (at least as expected) in mobile browsers, since they require explicit user input for each audio to play. However, it works on all modern browsers (at least all the ones I tested!) and it's a lot of fun to mess with!
